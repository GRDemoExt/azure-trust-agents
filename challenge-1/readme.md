# Challenge 1: Document Processing and Vectorized Search

**Expected Duration:** 60 minutes

## Introduction
This challenge guides you through building a compliance automation system using Azure AI Agent Service and Semantic Kernel. You will create and orchestrate three specialized agents to parse regulations, score transaction risks, and generate audit trailsâ€”enabling transparent, real-time compliance for financial institutions.

## What are we building?
In this challenge, we will create 3 specialized agents that form the backbone of our compliance automation and banking AI agent ecosystem:

| Agent                        | Goal                                                      | Datasource                                                                 | Tool                        |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Regulation Parsing Agent     | Extract enforceable rules from regulations and policies    | Regulatory documents, bank policies                                        | Cosmos DB, Azure AI Search |
| Transaction Risk Scoring Agent | Score transactions for risk and compliance in real time   | Live transaction data, rules from Cosmos DB                                | Cosmos DB                 |
| Audit Trail & Explanation Agent | Generate transparent, regulator-ready case files          | Alerts, risk scores, rules from Cosmos DB, citations from AI Search        | Cosmos DB, Azure AI Search |
