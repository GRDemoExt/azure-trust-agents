# Challenge 2: MCP Server Architecture

**Expected Duration:** 60 minutes

This challenge implements a distributed architecture using Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to separate concerns and improve scalability for compliance operations.

## Understanding Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers

### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants and applications to securely connect to external data sources and tools. MCP servers act as intermediaries that provide structured access to resources while maintaining security and control boundaries.

### Core Components

#### 1. **MCP Servers**
- **Definition**: Standalone processes that expose specific capabilities through a standardized protocol
- **Purpose**: Provide secure, controlled access to external resources and functionality
- **Architecture**: Run independently and communicate via JSON-RPC over various transports (stdio, HTTP, WebSocket)
- **Isolation**: Each server operates in its own process space, ensuring fault tolerance and security

#### 2. **Tools**
Tools are executable functions that MCP servers expose to AI assistants. In our compliance context, tools might include:
- **Data retrieval tools**: Query transaction databases, fetch regulatory documents
- **Analysis tools**: Calculate risk scores, validate compliance rules
- **Reporting tools**: Generate audit reports, create compliance summaries
- **Integration tools**: Connect to external APIs, access cloud resources

#### 3. **Data Sources (Resources)**
Resources represent data that MCP servers can provide access to:
- **Structured data**: Database records, API responses, configuration files
- **Unstructured data**: Documents, reports, logs, regulatory texts
- **Real-time data**: Live transaction feeds, monitoring alerts, system metrics
- **Historical data**: Archived records, audit trails, historical compliance reports

Each server will expose specific tools and resources relevant to its domain, allowing AI agents to access exactly the data and functionality they need for their compliance tasks.
