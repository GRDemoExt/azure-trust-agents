# Challenge 2: MCP Server Integration in Agent Framework

**Expected Duration:** 60 minutes

This challenge focuses on integrating a Fraud Alert Manager API as  Model Context Protocol (MCP) server using Azure API Management. This MCP server will then be connected to an agent, enabling the agent to leverage fraud alert capabilities.

We will not implement the fraud alerting logic itself, but rather we will leverage Azure API Management to expose a pre-built fraud detection API as MCP server. Sounds cool, right? No need to write new code, just configure and connect!

## What is a MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for AI models and systems to communicate context and metadata about their operations. It allows different components of an AI ecosystem to share information seamlessly, enabling better coordination and integration.

The Model Context Protocol enables, in this case, leverage fraud alert systems to be integrated with other agents, enhancing their capabilities and responsiveness:

- **Real-time alerts**: Immediate notifications when fraud patterns are detected
- **Context sharing**: Rich information exchange between systems
- **Tool orchestration**: Coordinated responses across multiple platforms

## What the MCP Does in This Challenge

In this fraud detection system, the MCP serves as a **bridge** between your AI agents and a pre-built Fraud Alert Manager API. Here's how it works:

```
AI Agent ‚Üí MCP Server ‚Üí Fraud Alert Manager API ‚Üí Alert System
```

### Key Functions:

1. **API Transformation**: Takes an existing Fraud Alert Manager API and exposes it as an MCP server through Azure API Management

2. **Real-time Alert Management**: Enables your fraud detection agents to:
   - **Create fraud alerts** when suspicious patterns are detected
   - **Retrieve existing alerts** to inform decision-making
   - **Manage alert lifecycle** (create, read, update status)

3. **Seamless Integration**: Allows your AI agents to communicate with external alert systems using a standardized protocol

### Practical Example:

When your fraud detection agent analyzes a transaction and finds it suspicious, it can:
1. Use the MCP server to create a fraud alert
2. Notify relevant systems immediately
3. Retrieve historical alert data to improve decision-making
4. Coordinate responses across multiple fraud detection platforms

The MCP essentially **extends your agent's capabilities** by giving it access to external services through a standardized, secure interface.

## Part 1 - Expose your API as MCP Server with API Management

### Understand the Fraud Alert Manager API

The Fraud Alert Manager API is a pre-built service that simulates fraud alerting functionalities. It provides endpoints to create, retrieve, and manage fraud alerts. This service is hosted on an Azure Container App and has been pre-configured and deployed for this challenge.

Before we start, familiarize yourself with the API documentation provided by the Swagger UI at your Container Apps URL:

```
RG=<your_resource_group_name>
CONTAINER_APP=$(az containerapp list --resource-group $RG --query "[0].name" -o tsv)
CONTAINER_APP_URL=$(az containerapp show --name $CONTAINER_APP --resource-group $RG --query properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn -o tsv)
echo "Swagger UI URL: http://$CONTAINER_APP_URL/v1/swagger-ui/index.html"
```

### Onboard you API to Azure API Management

1. **Import the Fraud Alert Manager API**:
   - Navigate to your API Management instance in the Azure portal.
   - Go to the "APIs" section and select "Add API".
   - Choose "OpenAPI"
   ![Onboard API](images/1_onboardapi.png)
   - Provide the URL to the Swagger JSON of the Fraud Alert Manager API, which can be found at:
   ```bash
   echo https://$CONTAINER_APP_URL/v1/v3/api-docs
   ```
   ![Import API](images/2_createapi.png)
   - Click "Create".

2. **Modify settings and validate the API has been imported successfully**:
   - Modify backend endpoint to point to the Fraud Alert Manager API.
   ```bash
   echo https://$CONTAINER_APP_URL/v1
   ```
   ![Modify Backend](images/3_modifybackend.png)
   ![Override endpoint](images/4_overridebackend.png)
   - Test API operations in the Azure portal to ensure everything is working correctly. For instance, get all alerts as shown in the video:

### Create MCP Server from your API

I will go straight to how to create an MCP server from your API. I encourage you to explore more about this in the [official doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/export-rest-mcp-server).

1. **Navigate to the MCP Servers section**:
   - Under "APIs", click on "MCP Servers (Preview)".
   - Click "Create MCP Server" and "Expose an API as MCP Server"
   ![Create MCP Server](images/6_mcpfromapi.png)

2. **Select the API and operations to expose**:
   - Select API, operations and provide details as shown below:
    ![Select API](images/7_createmcp.png)
   - Click "Create".

Finally, save the "MCP Server URL" of the newly created MCP server, you will need it in the next part. Add a new entry with the value in the '.env' file:
```bash
MCP_SERVER_ENDPOINT=<MCP_SERVER_URL>
```

## Part 2 - To Agent or Not to Agent: That's the Question

Having many types of agents in the Microsoft Agent Framework is vital because it ensures flexibility, modularity, and scalability when building AI systems that reflect different real-world roles and responsibilities.

Each agent type is specialized for a particular purpose ‚Äî conversational, orchestration, reasoning, or tooling. This flexibility lets developers choose exactly the right agent for each task, improving efficiency and reducing unnecessary complexity in system design. As of October 2025, the MAF support over [8 simple agent types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/user-guide/agents/agent-types/?pivots=programming-language-python#supported-agent-types). Some key aspect to have in mind are:
- **Flexibility** ‚Äì Each agent type is designed for a specific purpose, such as conversation, orchestration, reasoning, or tooling. This specialization lets developers match the right kind of intelligence or logic to each task, improving the system‚Äôs efficiency and focus.

- **Modularity** ‚Äì All agents share a unified base class but can be swapped, reused, or extended independently. This modular design allows incremental development, code reuse, and clear separation of concerns within multi-agent systems.

- **Scalability** ‚Äì Multiple agent types enable orchestration patterns where agents collaborate ‚Äî one plans, others act or validate. This structured coordination mirrors team workflows and scales easily from prototypes to enterprise deployments.

- **Interoperability** ‚Äì Through open standards like MCP, Agent-to-Agent (A2A), and OpenAPI, different agent types can connect to external systems and other frameworks. This ensures smooth communication across Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft 365, and third-party ecosystems.

- **Enterprise Readiness** ‚Äì Observability, compliance, and security are built into the Agent Framework. Different agent types support both creative reasoning and deterministic workflows, letting organizations combine innovation and governance within one unified runtime.

Now, in Challenge 1 we have created our 3 Azure AI Foundry agents and used them in a workflow. However, for this challenge we're going to explore a different approach by implementing our **Compliance Report Agent using [AzureOpenAIResponsesClient](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/user-guide/agents/agent-types/azure-openai-responses-agent?pivots=programming-language-python)** instead of the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service. This strategic choice makes perfect sense for compliance reporting because:

- **üéØ Stateless Operations**: Compliance reports are independent, one-time analyses that don't require conversation history or persistent state
- **‚ö° Performance Critical**: Regulatory compliance demands fast response times - direct API calls eliminate agent service overhead
- **üîß Enhanced MCP Integration**: The responses client provides seamless integration with our Fraud Alert Manager MCP server through `HostedMCPTool` with immediate execution (`approval_mode="never_require"`)
- **üí∞ Cost Efficiency**: Pay-per-API-call model is more economical for transactional compliance operations versus continuous agent hosting
- **üõ°Ô∏è Enterprise Simplicity**: Direct Azure OpenAI integration leverages existing governance, monitoring, and security patterns without additional agent infrastructure complexity

This demonstrates the **flexibility of the Microsoft Agent Framework** - choosing the right agent type for each specific use case rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. While Azure AI Foundry agents excel for conversational workflows requiring state management, AzureOpenAIResponsesClient is optimal for high-performance, stateless compliance operations with external system integrations.

Before we start, please do have a look at the Agent Framework documentation on how to use [MCP servers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/user-guide/model-context-protocol/using-mcp-tools?pivots=programming-language-python), as this is going to be key in this second part of our challenge.

### Some context

As this is our last agent, and we are creating it individually, we will use the file `agents/risk-analyser-tx-summary.md` as a sample output of the result from the risk analyser agent (Agent number 2 in our sequence). 


### Define the MCP as a Tool in the Agent

Now, it is time to configure a simple ChatAgent that uses the MCP server. 

The agent has been implemented for you in the `challenge-2/agents/fraud_alert_agent.py` file.

We have left a placeholder in the code so you can add the MCP server as a tool. In line 99, find:

```python
            tools=HostedMCPTool(
```

Add your current configuration:

```python
            name="Fraud Alert Manager MCP",
            url=mcp_endpoint,
            description="Manages fraud alerts and escalations for financial transactions",
            approval_mode="never_require",
            headers={
                "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key": mcp_subscription_key
            } if mcp_subscription_key else {}
     ),
``` 
About this configuration: 
- The kind of tool is [HostedMCPTool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/user-guide/model-context-protocol/using-mcp-tools?pivots=programming-language-python#hostedmcptool)
- `approval_mode="never_require"` enables immediate execution without requiring approval for each MCP tool call
- The subscription key header is required to authenticate against the API Management instance. Good stuff if you want to control access to your MCP server!
- `description` provides context to the AI agent about what this MCP server does for better tool selection

### Run the Agent

To validate that the final Fraud Alert API is receiving requests from the agent, you can monitor the logs of the Container App hosting the Fraud Alert Manager API. In the terminal, run:

```bash
az containerapp logs show --name $CONTAINER_APP --resource-group $RG --follow
```

Now, run the agent in another terminal:

```bash
cd challenge-2/agents
python compliance_report_responses_client.py
```

See output on both terminals. You should see the agent sending requests to the Fraud Alert Manager API and receiving responses.


## Part 3 - Let's Update our Workflow!

The workflow we are building in Challenge 2 represents a significant evolution from Challenge 1, demonstrating the Microsoft Agent Framework's flexibility through a sophisticated hybrid approach that combines Azure AI Foundry agents with AzureOpenAIResponsesClient for enhanced MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration.

The workflow maintains the proven 3-executor sequential pattern (Customer Data ‚Üí Risk Analyzer ‚Üí Compliance Report) but introduces a groundbreaking the dual-agent architecture, following the principle of **"right tool for the right job"**  - using Azure AI Foundry agents where conversational state and Azure service integration excel, and switching to the responses client where direct API performance and MCP tool integration can provide superior results.

Let's go ahead and open our `sequential_workflow_chal2.py` file. Now, we are not dependent on sample data anymore, we will find a full integration for 3 agents, making the newly made Compliance Report Executor robust and one step closer to being production-ready.

```python
cd agents
python sequential_workflow_chal2.py
```

Have a look at the major changes from the previous to this newly made workflow. When you run it, it will take Transaction `TX1012` that should be signaled as high risk. As we've seen before, our robust system works in the following way:

### Scoring Components & Methodology

#### 1. Primary Risk Score Calculation (0-100 Scale)

- **High-Risk Countries (75‚Äì85 points):** Transactions to sanctioned or high-risk jurisdictions (Iran, Russia, North Korea, Syria, Yemen, etc.)
- **Large Transaction Amounts (20 points):** Transactions exceeding $10,000 USD threshold
- **Suspicious Patterns (30 points):** AI-detected anomalous behavior patterns
- **Sanctions Concerns (85 points):** Any sanctions-related flags or matches
- **Customer Risk Profile (Variable points):**
  - New accounts (<30 days): Additional risk weighting  
  - Low device trust score (<0.5): Security concern indicator  
  - Past fraud history: Historical risk amplifier

### Scoring Algorithm

```
Base Score = 0
+ High-Risk Country: +75-85 points
+ Large Amount (>$10k): +20 points  
+ Suspicious Activity: +30 points
+ Sanctions Flag: +85 points
+ Customer Risk Factors: Variable
Maximum Score: Capped at 100
```
#### 2. Risk Level Classification

- **Low Risk (0‚Äì49):** Standard monitoring sufficient  
- **Medium Risk (50‚Äì74):** Enhanced monitoring recommended  
- **High Risk (75‚Äì100):** Immediate action required

#### 3. Compliance Rating System

- **COMPLIANT:** Low-risk transactions meeting all regulatory requirements  
- **CONDITIONAL_COMPLIANCE:** Medium risk requiring enhanced monitoring  
- **NON_COMPLIANT:** High-risk transactions violating compliance thresholds

#### Business Impact Scoring

- **Score 0‚Äì49 (Low Risk):**  
  - Action: APPROVE transaction  
  - Monitoring: Standard procedures  
  - Filing: Routine record keeping  

- **Score 50‚Äì74 (Medium Risk):**  
  - Action: INVESTIGATE further  
  - Monitoring: Enhanced customer monitoring  
  - Filing: Internal risk documentation  

- **Score 75‚Äì100 (High Risk):**  
  - Action: BLOCK transaction immediately  
  - Monitoring: Freeze account pending investigation  
  - Filing: Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) to regulators
