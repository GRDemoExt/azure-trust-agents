customer name: David Sancho
risk_score: 10
risk_level: Low
reason: 
- The transaction amount of approximately $9998 USD equivalent (9998 EUR) is just below the high amount threshold of $10,000, confirming the analysis that "High Amount" risk indicator is false.
- The destination country is DE (Germany), which is not in the high-risk countries list (NG, IR, RU, KP), thus validating "High Risk Country" as false.
- The customer's account age is 365 days, well above the suspicious account age threshold of 30 days, so "New Account" is false.
- The device trust score is 0.8, significantly above the low device trust threshold of 0.5.
- No past fraud history is noted.
- No sanctions or politically exposed persons (PEP) flags found related to the customer or transaction; Germany and Spain are both high compliance jurisdictions with strong AML/KYC frameworks.
- Regulatory references retrieved from EU AML Directive and FATF Recommendations emphasize enhanced due diligence for transactions above $10,000 or involving high-risk countries. Since these do not apply, transaction risk is low.
- Given the low risk factors identified and no triggering signals for suspicious activity, AML/KYC requirements are met satisfactorily.
- Recommend transaction approval without further escalation but maintaining routine monitoring per typical AML program standards.
- No immediate regulatory reporting (e.g., suspicious activity report) is warranted.
- Maintain transaction documentation for audit trail and future compliance checks.

Summary: The transaction TX2002 from customer CUST1005 is low risk and complies with AML/KYC regulations. The transaction does not meet thresholds or exhibit characteristics necessitating blocking or enhanced investigation. Therefore, approval is recommended with standard monitoring.
