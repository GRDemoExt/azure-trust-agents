### ❓ **"Do I need to change my existing setup?"**
**No!** The enhanced workflow is a drop-in replacement. Same environment variables, same functionality, just with observability added.

### ❓ **"Will this slow down my fraud detection?"**
**Minimal impact.** Observability adds ~1-5ms overhead per transaction. The insights gained far outweigh the tiny performance cost.

### ❓ **"What if I don't want observability?"**
**Just don't set `ENABLE_OTEL=true`.** The workflow runs exactly like the original without any observability overhead.

### ❓ **"Is this secure for production?"**
**Yes!** Sensitive data tracing is disabled by default. Only metadata (transaction IDs, risk scores, decisions) are traced, not actual customer data.

### ❓ **"Can I customize what gets monitored?"**
**Absolutely!** The code is designed to be easily customizable. You can add your own metrics, modify trace attributes, or integrate with different monitoring systems.
